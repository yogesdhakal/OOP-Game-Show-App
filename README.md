** The Phrase Hunter Game **

 - The index page shows a button to start the game with the name of the game
 - Once the start button is clicked the game is revealed 
 - The game board has a keyboard and the pharse the player has to guess above it, which is blank and hearts below to represent the number of chances to guess
 - If the user guesses the correct letter in the phrase the corresponding box with the letter is revealed.
 - When the user guesses the wrong letter one heart will decrease 

** Added Style **
 
- To make it look more interesting , a sliding color background is applied to the phrase letter box when the user makes a correct guess. I have used css code from 
  code pen and set up an interval timer.
